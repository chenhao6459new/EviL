EviL: Just another ILLC MSc thesis

EviL is the abbreviation of "Evidentialist Logic", which is an
epistemic logic I invented when thinking about my ideas about
epistemology.

At one point, I decided that I wanted to verify its correctness
using computer assisted verification; hence, EviL became a
substantive programming effort as well a philosophical logic.

EviL/
    This directory contains the code for the
    computer assisted formalization in Isabelle/HOL of 
    the completeness theorem of my logic.

Humans/
    This directory contains my MSc thesis on my logic. It has a
    lot more pictures and is more interesting to read than the
    computer code.

isa-make-output/
    Isabelle/HOL automatically generates output from
    the formal proof code - this directory contains that output.
    It shall ultimately be a large appendix of my MSc thesis.
