EviL: Just another ILLC MSc thesis in symbolic nonsense

EviL/
   This directory contains the code for the
   computer assisted formalization in Isabelle/HOL of 
   the completeness theorem of EviL.

Humans/
   This directory contains a MSc thesis that a human 
   supervisor forced me to write.  The thesis contains philosophy,
   which is some kind of empty activity according to a reading of
   early Wittgenstein. It's sort of like building sandcastles this way, 
   only far less interesting/applied.

isa-make-output/
    Isabelle/HOL automatically generates output from
    the formal proof code - this directory contains that output.
    It shall ultimately be a large appendix of the central thesis.
