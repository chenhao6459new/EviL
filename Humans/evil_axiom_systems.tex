In this section, we shall present the axiomatics for multi-agent
\textsc{EviL}. The axioms of \textsc{EviL} are presented in 
Table \ref{table:axioms}, which comprises a Hilbert systems for
$\vdash_{\textsc{EviL}}$\footnote{By abuse of notation, we shall omit
  subscripts where they are thought to not be ambiguous}.  In addition
to giving each axiom, we provide a philosophical reading of what each
axiom says.  As remarked in \S\ref{validities}, \textsc{EviL} is not
\emph{normal}, that is it is not closed under variable substitution.

Needless to say, these axioms shall be the focus of study for all of
our future investigations in \S\ref{army-of-darkness}.

% We immediately have the following theorem:
% \begin{theorem}[Soundness]
% If $\vdash \phi$ then for any model $\mathfrak{M}$ and any 
% $(a,A) \in \mathfrak{M}$ we have that $\mathfrak{M},(a,A) \models \phi$ 
% \end{theorem}

% This logic makes true a variety of relationships between the various
% modalities, which are given in the following lemma:
% \begin{lemma}\label{equivs}
% We have the following provable equivalences:
% \begin{eqnarray*} \vdash \Nec_X \phi \IFF \BB_X \Nec_X \phi & \hspace{1cm} \vdash \Nec_X \phi \IFF \Nec_X \BB_Y \phi \hspace{1cm}  & \vdash \Nec_X \phi \IFF \Nec_X \BBI_Y \phi \\
%  \vdash \BB_X \phi \IFF \BB_X \BB_X \phi & \vdash \BBI_X \phi \IFF
%  \BBI_X \BBI_X \phi & \vdash \PP_X \IFF \BB_X \PP_X\end{eqnarray*}

% &\vdash \PP_X \IFF \DDI_X \PP_X \\
% &\vdash \phi \IFF \psi \textup{ implies } \vdash \chi \IFF \chi[\phi/\psi]
% \end{eqnarray*}
% \ldots where $\chi[\phi/\psi]$ is the same as $\chi$ but every occurrence of $\phi$ as a subformula is replaced by $\psi$.
% $\hfill\dashv$
% \end{lemma}
