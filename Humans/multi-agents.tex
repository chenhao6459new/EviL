In this section I turn to extending the semantics for
\tmtextsc{EviL} from a single agent, as presented in \S(FIXME), to
accommodate multiple agents.  This is primarily of interest since further
results in \textsc{EviL}, namely completeness, can naturally be
abstracted beyond the single agent case.  But I will freely admit that
my \textsc{EviL} intuitions are principally grounded in the single
agent case -- I recommend thinking about the multi-agent case as just
a generalization of the single agent case.

The following provides the definition of the language of multi-agent \textsc{EviL}:
\begin{definition} Define $\mathcal{L} (\Phi, \mathcal{A})$ by the following Backus-Naur grammar:
\[ \phi \ {::=} \  p \in \Phi \  | \  \phi
   \rightarrow \psi \  | \  \bot \  |
   \  \Box_X \phi \  | \  \boxminus_X \phi
   \  | \  \boxplus_X \phi \  | \ 
   \circlearrowleft_X \]
$\ldots$where $X \in \mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ is non-empty.
\end{definition}

As in the single agent case, multi-agent \tmtextsc{EviL} models are sets $\Omega
\subseteq \powerset \Phi \times (  (\powerset
\mathcal{L}_0 (\Phi))^\mathcal{A})$ -- that is, $\Omega$ is a set of
pairs of sets of proposition letters, and indexed sets of
propositional formulae.
 
The semantic entailment relation for
multi-agent \textsc{EviL} is 
\[ (\VDash) \colons \powerset ( \powerset \Phi \times ( \mathcal{A}
   \rightarrow \powerset \mathcal{L}_0 (\Phi))) \rightarrow \powerset \Phi
   \times ( \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \powerset \mathcal{L}_0 (\Phi))
   \rightarrow \mathcal{L} (\Phi, \mathcal{A}) \rightarrow
   \textup{\textsf{bool}}. \]
The input/output behavior of $(\VDash)$ is just as before in
\S(FIXME), the only difference in this setting is that instead of
taking a pair as an input, where the second element is a
set, it takes an indexed set.
% That is, $(\VDash)$ is a function that:
% \begin{itemizedot}
%   \item Takes as input:
% \begin{itemizedot}
%   \item An \evil model
%   \item A pair $(a, A)$ where
%   \begin{itemizedot}
%     \item $a$ is a set of proposition letters
%     \item $A:\mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{L}_0 (\Phi)$ assigns sets of formulae to agents.
%   \end{itemizedot}
%   \item A formula in the language $\mathcal{L} (\Phi, \mathcal{A})$
%   \end{itemizedot}
%   \item Gives as output: a truth value in $\textup{\textsf{bool}}$
% \end{itemizedot}
I shall now provide a formal definition of the semantics for
multi-agent $(\VDash)$:
{\footnote{Where $X \in \mathcal{A}$, I
use $A_X$ to denote $A (X)$ provided that $A \colons \mathcal{A} \rightarrow
\powerset \mathcal{L}_0 (\Phi)$}}
\begin{definition}
\begin{align*}
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash} p & {\iff}p{\in}a\\
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash} {\phi}{\rightarrow}{\psi} &
  {\iff}{\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}{\phi}\text{ implies
  }{\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}{\psi}\\
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}{\bot} & {\iff} False\\
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}\Box_X {\phi} & {\iff}{\forall}(b,B){\in}{\Omega}.
  ({\forall}{\psi}{\in}A_X. b{\models}{\psi})\text{ implies
  }{\Omega},(b,B){\VDash}{\phi}\\
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}{\boxminus}_X{\phi} &
  {\iff}{\forall}(b,B){\in}{\Omega}. a=b\text{ and }B_X{\subseteq}A_X\text{
  implies }{\Omega},(b,B){\VDash}{\phi}\\
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}{\boxplus}_X{\phi} &
  {\iff}{\forall}(b,B){\in}{\Omega}. a=b\text{ and }B_X{\supseteq}A_X\text{
  implies }{\Omega},(b,B){\VDash}{\phi}\\
  {\Omega},(a,A){\VDash}{\circlearrowleft}_X & {\iff}
  {\forall}{\psi}{\in}A_X.a{\models}{\psi}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Just as in \S(FIXME), Lemma (FIXME) and Theorem
\ref{theorem-theorem} can be seen to obtain for the new generalized
semantics.  Furthermore, all of the validities mentioned in \S\ref{validities}
and \S\ref{elimination} hold, 
along with Theorem \ref{vanishing}, where $\Box$, $\Pos$, $\BM$, $\BP$, $\DM$, $\DP$
and $\PP$ are all replaced with $\Box_X$, $\Pos_X$, $\BM_X$, $\BP_X$, $\DM_X$, $\DP_X$
and $\PP_X$ respectively, for any fixed $X \in \mathcal{A}$.
Furthermore, compactness still fails, just as presented in \S

Finally, there is are two novel validities that these semantics give
rise to:
\begin{equationarray*} & \VDash \Box_X \phi \to \Box_X \BM_Y \phi \\
& \VDash \Box_X \phi \to \Box_X \BP_Y \phi \\
 \end{equationarray*}
This is just to say, that as the \textsc{EviL} agent's deliberative process was opaque
to her beliefs in the single agent case, as expressed in
\eqref{dontcare1} and \eqref{dontcare2} in \S(FIXME), 
in a similar fashion she cannot read anyone else's mind, nor anyone
else hers.

I will admit that little use shall be made of \textsc{EviL} generalized
this way, since the single agent case is far more natural to think
about for me.  However, it will be of interest to the main theorems of
\textsc{EviL}, which I shall present in \S(FIXME), that they be proved
in the widest generality.
