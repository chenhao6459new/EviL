There are four points of failure of \textsc{EviL} that I feel must be
addressed:
\begin{myRoman}
  \item \textsc{EviL} is not really a logic, because it is non-normal
    and non-compact, so it therefore any kind of reasonable algebraic
    duality is impossible \citep[for details on this, see][chapter 5]{blackburn_modal_2001} 
  \item \textsc{EviL} is not dynamic and therefore fails to conform to
    the prevailing paradigm for epistemic logics
    \item \textsc{EviL} is not completely formalized - only the
      completeness theorem for the central axiom system for
      \textsc{EviL} has been produced; none of the many auxiliary
      results have been formalized
    \item \textsc{EviL} is inhuman - the assumptions it makes for the
      nature of knowledge and \textsc{EviL} agent's cognitive
      abilities are unrealistic
\end{myRoman}
