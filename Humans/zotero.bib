	abstract = {Abstract  Current dynamic-epistemic logics model different types of information change in multi-agent scenarios. We generalize these
logics to a probabilistic setting, obtaining a calculus for multi-agent update with three natural slots: prior probability
on states, occurrence probabilities in the relevant process taking place, and observation probabilities of events. To match
this update mechanism, we present a complete dynamic logic of information change with a probabilistic character. The completeness
proof follows a compositional methodology that applies to a much larger class of dynamic-probabilistic logics as well. Finally,
we discuss how our basic update rule can be parameterized for different update policies, or learning methods.},

We also consider a related notion, that of safe belief, which is a weak (non-negatively introspective) type of “knowledge”. We develop a probabilistic version of this concept (“degree
of safety”) and we analyze its role in games. We completely axiomatize the logic of conditional belief, knowledge and safe
belief over conditional probabilistic models. We develop a theory of probabilistic dynamic belief revision, introducing probabilistic
“action models” and proposing a notion of probabilistic update product, that comes together with appropriate reduction laws.},

In a Topoi it is possible to define adequate notions of membership, elements and subobjects, power ''sets'', and finally, every Topoi has an internal logic able to justify any reasoning carried inside it. Most of the cases, this logic is not Classical {(Boolean).} The general logic for the Topoi is Intuitionistic Higher-order Logic. Topoi have their linguistic counter-part provided by Local Set Theories {(LST).} There is a deductive apparatus, in the style of Sequent Calculus, able to justify logical consequence inside any {LST.} Counterfactuals are subtle conditionals largely studied by the philosophical and logic community. Since Lewis, counterfactual have a uniform semantics provided by means of Neighborhood systems on top a possible world style semantics. In this article, taking into account the fundamental theorem on Topoi, we define, by means of the internal logic of Graphs, Lewis counterfactuals and show how to use the {LST} deductive apparatus to prove properties on counterfactual logic. This article can be also used as an initial step towards the definition of deductive systems for counterfactual logic, taken in an alternative way the ones already existent in the logic literature.},

We take a broad view of the Bayesian approach as dictating inter alia that from the perspective of a given logic, rational degrees of belief are those representable by probability functions from the class appropriate to that logic. Classical Bayesianism, which fixes the logic as classical logic, is only one version of this general approach. Another, which we call Intuitionistic Bayesianism, selects intuitionistic logic as the preferred logic and the associated class of probability functions as the right class of candidate representions of epistemic states (rational allocations of degrees of belief). Various objections to classical Bayesianism are, we argue, best met by passing to intuitionistic Bayesianism—in which the probability functions are taken relative to intuitionistic logic—rather than by adopting a radically {non-Kolmogorovian,} for example, nonadditive, conception of (or substitute for) probability functions, in spite of the popularity of the latter response among those who have raised these objections. The interest of intuitionistic Bayesianism is further enhanced by the availability of a Dutch Book argument justifying the selection of intuitionistic probability functions as guides to rational betting behavior when due consideration is paid to the fact that bets are settled only when/if the outcome bet on becomes known.},

Classical, intuitionistic, quantum and non-modal linear logics, are all obtained as extensions in a uniform way and in a single framework. We isolate three properties, which characterize B positively: reflection, symmetry and visibility. A logical constant obeys to the principle of reflection if it is characterized semantically by an equation binding it with a metalinguistic link between assertions, and if its syntactic inference rules are obtained by solving that equation. All connectives of basic logic satisfy reflection. To the control of weakening and contraction of linear logic, basic logic adds a strict control of contexts, by requiring that all active formulae in all rules are isolated, that is visible. From visibility, cut-elimination follows. The full, geometric symmetry of basic logic induces known symmetries of its extensions, and adds a symmetry among them, producing the structure of a cube.},

In contrast to its predecessors and most other implementations, {Isabelle/HOL} datatypes may be mutually and indirect recursive,
even infinitely branching. We also support inverted datatype definitions for characterizing existing types as being inductive
ones later. All our constructions are fully definitional according to established {HOL} tradition. Stepping back from the logical
details, we also see this work as a typical example of what could be called {“Formal-Logic} Engineering”. We observe that building
realistic theorem proving environments involves further issues rather than pure logic only.},

	abstract = {In the conclusion of {[HM2]} Halpern and Moses expressed their interest in a logical system in which one could talk about knowledge and belief (and belief about knowledge, knowledge about belief and so on). We investigate such systems. In the first part of the paper knowledge and belief, without time, are considered. Common knowledge and common belief are defined and compared. A logical system and a family of models are proposed, a completeness result is proved and a decision procedure described. In the second part of the paper, time is considered. Different notions of beliefs are distinguished, obeying different properties of persistence. One interpretation of belief which obeys a very strong persistence axiom is put forward and used in the analysis of "wise men" puzzle.},

	abstract = {We investigate a peculiar intuitionistic modal logic, called Propositional Lax Logic {(PLL),} which has promising applications to the formal verification of computer hardware. The logic has emerged from an attempt to express correctness up to behavioural constraints--a central notion in hardware verification--as a logical modality. As a modal logic it is special since it features a single modal operator [circle, open] that has a flavour both of possibility and of necessity. In the paper we provide the motivation for {PLL} and present several technical results. We investigate some of its proof-theoretic properties, presenting a cut-elimination theorem for a standard Gentzen-style sequent presentation of the logic. We go on to define a new class of fallible two-frame Kripke models for {PLL.} These models are unusual since they feature worlds with inconsistent information; furthermore, the only frame condition imposed is that the [circle, open]-frame be a subrelation of the [superset or implies]-frame. We give a natural translation of these models into Goldblatt's -space models of {PLL.} Our completeness theorem for these models yields a Gödel-style embedding of {PLL} into a classical bimodal theory of type {(S4,} S4) and underpins a simple proof of the finite model property. We proceed to prove soundness and completeness of several theories for specialized classes of models. We conclude with a brief exploration of two concrete and rather natural types of model from hardware verification for which the modality [circle, open] models correctness up to timing constraints. We obtain decidability of [circle, open]-free fragment of the logic of the first type of model, which coincides with the stable form of Maksimova's intermediate {logicL[Pi].}},
