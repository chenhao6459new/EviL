With the results of the previous sections provided, we may now show
that \textsc{EviL} is complete for \textsc{EviL} models.

\begin{theorem}
If $\nvdash \phi$ then there is some model $\mathfrak{M}$ and some $(a,A) \in \mathfrak{M}$ such that $\mathfrak{M},(a,A) \nmodels \phi$ 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Assume $\nvdash \phi$, then by Lemmas \ref{truth} and \ref{partly} we have some partly \textsc{EviL} Kripke 
	structure and world such that $\mathbb{A},a \nVdash \phi$.  By Lemma \ref{bisimulation} we have that there is a 
	completely \textsc{EviL} Kripke structure $\mathbb{B}$ such that $\mathbb{A}\ \underline{\IFF}{}\ \mathbb{B}$, thus there is some world $b$ such that $\mathbb{B},b \nVdash \phi$.  
	Finally by Lemma \ref{translation-lemma} we have that there's a model $\mathfrak{C}$ in \textsc{EviL} semantics and a pair $(c,C) \in \mathfrak{C}$ such that $\mathfrak{C},(c,C) \nmodels \phi$.
\end{proof}
