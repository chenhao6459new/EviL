\section{Philosophy}\label{philosophy}
\subsection{Forward}
The idea of applying modal logic to the study of knowledge more or
less began with \citet{hintikka_knowledge_1969}.  In this it is
suggested that one can use the possible world framework of modal logic
to model ideal logical agents, and reason about concepts like
knowledge and belief as modal $\Box$s.  In Hintikka's original text,
some philosophical emphasis is put on the ideas of
\emph{introspection}, which have two formulations:
\begin{bul}
	\item Positive: $\Box \phi \to \Box\Box \phi$ - ``If the agent knows a fact, then she knows that she knows this.''
	\item Negative: $\Pos \phi \to \Box\Pos \phi$ - ``If the agent does not know a fact, she knows that she does not know this.''
\end{bul}
Intuitively, the second idea seems like something one ought to reject
outright.  Many will recall the somewhat famous piece of sophistry put
forward by former US secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld
\citep{rumsfeld_defense.gov_2002}:
\begin{quote}
Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting
to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we
know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we
know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown
unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks
throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is
the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.\end{quote}

This quote was ultimately part of a larger, more diabolical
justification for criminal military action.  Still, it is undeniably
at variance with negative introspection; and despite its malicious
intent behind it, it is compelling.  Furthermore, Hintikka also
rejects negative introspection; and while it would seem from the above
quote that Rumsfeld does not reject positive introspection, Hintikka
does so explicitly \citep{hintikka_knowledge_1969}.

Despite philosophical objections, the received view in modern
epistemic logic embraces both negative and positive introspection.  In
addition, the following axiom is also considered:
\begin{bul}
	\item Reflection: $\Box \phi \to \phi$ - ``If the agent knows a some statement, that statement is true''
\end{bul}
These three axioms together, along with the axioms and rules of elementary modal logic, form C.I. Lewis' system $S5$ \citep{lewis_symbolic_1951}.  Under correspondence theory, these axioms express that the underlying accessibility modal relation is an equivalence relation. That is, they express that the ideal agent under investigation has partitioned their state space into \emph{information states}.  It is well known that game theory shares an equivalent notion of information states (see, for instance, \citet{halpern_set-theoretic_1999} and \citet[chapter 3]{rubinstein_modeling_1998}).

And while this view of knowledge finds industrial application, such as
in \citet{agray_ban_2002} and
\citet{hommersom_toward_2005,hommersom_update_2004}, it presents an
perspective on knowledge which is not very human.\footnote{Admittedly,
  most of the criticisms I shall levy against mainstream epistemic
  logic in the subsequent discussion are known to the
  epistemic logic community.  I understand it is preferred that they
  be swept under the carpet and never mentioned, as they are fairly painful
  to remember for epistemic logic enthusiasts. I am not particularly
  apologetic in recounting the basic failures of epistemic logic as an 
  intellectual exercise.  The discussion I present in this section is
  intended for people new to epistemic logic, who may be unaware of
  its basic inadequacies and irrelevance.}


\subsection{Thermometers}\label{thermometers}
Imagine a 1 m$^3$ box with a thermometer sealed hermetically inside, as in Fig.  \ref{fig:therm1}.  Further, pretend that the thermometer reads 290 Kelvin.  How many moles of gas are in the chamber?

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{thermometer.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A thermometer in a box}
\label{fig:therm1}
\end{figure}

The answer is indeterminate.  Recall that the the \emph{ideal gas law} was originally discovered by \'{E}mile Clapeyon \citep{clapeyron_mmoire_1834}; in modern parlance it reads:
\[ P V = n R T\]
Where:
\begin{bul}
\item $P$ is the pressure in pascals
\item $V$ is the volume in cubic meters
\item $n$ is the number of moles of gas
\item $T$ is the temperature in Kelvins
\item $R$ is the \emph{ideal gas constant}, $\approx8.3$ J$\cdot$K$^{-1}\cdot$mol$^{-1}$
\end{bul}

With the ideal gas law, we can see that the thermometer is effectively in an epistemic space.  To be explicit, consider the basic modal language with the following grammar:
\[ \phi ::= x \textup{ pascals}  \ |\ y \textup{ moles}  \ |\ z \textup{ Kelvin}  \ |\ \phi \to \psi \ |\ \bot \ |\ \Box \phi \]

This can be seen to be an ordinary modal language with three kinds of letters.  Under this language, we can naturally understand that the thermometer is an epistemic agent in an $S5$ model for this language.  Explicitly, the model is the triple $\langle W, V, \sim \rangle$ where:
\begin{bul}
	\item $W$ is pairs $(P,n)$ where $P$ is some positive pressure in pascals and $n$ is some positive number of moles.
	\item $V$ is defined as follows:
	\begin{bul}
		\item $(P,n) \in V(x \textup{\ pascals})$ if $P = x$
		\item $(P,n) \in V(y \textup{\ moles})$ if $n = y$
		\item $(P,n) \in V(z \textup{\ Kelvin})$ if $z = \frac{P}{n \cdot R}$
	\end{bul}
	\item Finally, $(P,n) \sim (P',n')$ holds if and only if $P \cdot n' = P' \cdot n$ 
\end{bul}
We can also visualize the information states in Fig.  \ref{fig:therm2}; they form rays emanating from the origin.

Now, I give this example because it is representative of the perspective provided by epistemic logic - agents are essentially elaborate \emph{sensor networks} in the received view.  Imagine we were to go up to an agent and ask her why she believes some proposition $\phi$; what could she possibly say?  She'd say she feels $\phi$ with every fiber of her being, that it's true in every conceivable world she can think of.  The reason that $\phi$ occurs to the agent is because it's what her sensory instruments tell her. Methodologically, this is exactly the same as the way the thermometer was modeled in the previous thought experiment. To this end I shall abbreviate the received view on epistemic logic as the \emph{thermometer theory of knowledge}.

This isn't knowledge.  The thermometer theory is inadequate:  if I were to ask a person why she believes a proposition $\phi$, I probably wouldn't accept appeals that she cannot conceive of the contrary as possible.  I'd want some kind of explanation, especially if $\phi$ were a piece of mathematics, to give principle example.  It would certainly make the enterprise of mathematics far simpler if proving theorems amounted to exhibiting that their negation is not imaginable.  This gives rise to the following philosophical observation:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Thermometer Principle}: \emph{Traditional epistemic agents, like thermometers, don't really have knowledge, since one must have reasons for the things they believe.}
\end{quote}

As I will elaborate, the above assertion follows from more general concerns I have with epistemic logic.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{therm.pdf} 
\end{center}
\caption{Thermometer information states}
\label{fig:therm2}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Explicit Justification}\label{explicit}

I hold that the \emph{Thermometer Principle} is an expression of the following more fundamental idea:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Justification Principle}: \emph{In order to know something, one must have a some kind of sufficient justification.}
\end{quote}
I contend that derivation in a logical calculus is suitable
justification for the above principle. In light of this, all of my
future developments shall center around the idea that in order to have
knowledge, one must have a special derivation.  Since knowledge
entails belief \citep[under the traditional view in]{gettier_is_1963},
I have decided to simply equate belief with having a derivation.
Hence knowledge can then be thought of a species of this kind of
derivational belief. And while it is perhaps as bad an
oversimplification as the thermometer view I have previously
criticized, my modeling technique assumes \emph{doxastic omniscience},
which is to say that I assume an agent's beliefs are closed under
logical consequence\footnote{\cite{hintikka_knowledge_1969} assumes a
  similar perspective; for modeling purposes, the agent is assumed to
  have adequate time to realize the consequences of their beliefs.
  Similarly, we might interpret belief as what is refered to in
  \citet{levesque_logic_1984} as ``implicit belief.''}.  This will be illustrated shortly.

The \emph{Justification Principle} is similar to demanding
\emph{explicit justification} for beliefs in epistemic logic. I am not
the first person to suggest this. The modern hunt for logics of
explicit justification appears to have been initiated in
\citet{van_benthem_reflectionsepistemic_1991}\footnote{While this
  paper is considered seminal, it should be remarked that research
  into this subject began prior to it.  Specifically, the
  \emph{phrase} ``explicit belief'' appears to have its origins in
  \citep{levesque_logic_1984}.}. One framework which has been proposed
to achieve this is \emph{Justification Logic}
\citep{artemov_introducing_2005,artemov_justification_2007,fitting_logic_2004,fitting_logic_2005}.
Alternative frameworks for reasoning about implicit/explicit
information have also been proposed in \citet{van_benthem_inference_2009} and
\citet{velzquez-quesada_inference_2009}.


\subsection{Sketch}\label{sketch}

These analyses mentioned in the previous section are all quite
sophisticated; I have in mind something comparatively na\"{i}ve.  
I shall present a sketch in this section -- that being said I intend
to be extremely informal.  A formal development of the ideas shall be 
given in \S\ref{evil-grammar}.  With this proviso, consider the basic
modal language $\mathcal{L}(\Phi)$:
\[ \phi ::= p \in \Phi \ |\ \phi \to \psi \ | \ \bot \ |\ \Box \phi \]

Further, let $\Omega \subseteq \powerset \Phi \times \powerset \mathcal{L}(\Phi)$, that is, let $\Omega$ be pairs of sets of letters and formulae. Define the following truth predicate $\VDash$ recursively as follows:
\begin{empt}
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash p \iff p \in a$
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi \to \psi \iff \Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi$ implies $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \psi$
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \bot \iff False$
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \Box \phi \iff $ for all $(b,B) \in \Omega$, $\Omega,(b,B) \VDash A$ implies $\Omega, (b,B)\VDash \phi$ for all $(b,B) \in \Omega$
\end{empt}

Since the semantics like the above shall be the principle objects of
study, I will give how I read them philosophically.  In these
semantics, instead of thinking of every world individually, I think of
every world as containing facts and a part of the agent's mind.  This
part of the agent's mind is represented by what I shall refer to as
propositions which she ascents to. I shall refer to these
interchangeably as \emph{premises}, \emph{assumptions}, \emph{basic
  beliefs}, \emph{experiences} or \emph{evidence}.  On the basis of
her evidence, I imagine the agent composes arguments using the logic
of semantics suggested and all of the worlds that are possible.  In
this way, I consider this approach to be roughly in line with the
\emph{evidentialist} view on epistemology, which
\citet{conee_evidentialism_2004} describe as follows:
\begin{quote}
  [E]videntialism is a supervenience thesis according to which facts
  about whether or not a person is justified in believing a
  proposition supervene on facts describing the evidence that the
  person has.
\end{quote}
$\ldots$however, while my sympathies are with this perspective on
epistemology, they differ foundationally - while evidentialism
develops intuitions using analytical philosophy, our approach shall be
founded in formal semantics like the one above.

That is, if a proper foundation can be provided at all.  Admittedly,
the above formulation of truth immediately runs into a \emph{paradox}
- for instance, if 
\begin{bul}
\item $a:=\varnothing$ 
\item $A:=\{\Box \bot\}$
\item and $\Omega:= \{(a,A)\}$
\end{bul}
\ldots then $\Omega,(a,A)\VDash \Box \bot$ has an indeterminate truth
value.  So let $\mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$ be the propositional fragment of
$\mathcal{L}$; we shall restrict the truth value to $\Omega\subseteq
\Phi \times \powerset \mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$.  This suffices to make
every truth value of this logic determinate.

We may observe that the logic of these semantics is familiar:
\begin{prop}
Assuming that the set of proposition letters $\Phi$ is infinite
$$\vdash_{K} \phi\textup{ if and only if } \Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi \textup{ for all finite $\Omega$ for all $(a,A) \in \Omega$}$$
\ldots where $K$ is basic modal logic.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 Left to right is trivial, so we shall focus on right to left.  Assume
 that $\nvdash_{K} \phi$, then we know from completeness and the
 finite model property that there's some finite model
 $\mathbb{M}=\langle W^\mathbb{M}, V^\mathbb{M}, R^\mathbb{M}\rangle$ and world $w \in W^\mathbb{M}$ such that $\mathbb{M},w \nVdash \phi$ (see \citet[chapters 2 \& 4]{blackburn_modal_2001} for details of these facts).

Now let $\Lambda_\phi$ be the proposition letters that occur as
subformulae of $\phi$, and let $\rho_\phi : W^\mathbb{M} \hookrightarrow \Phi \bs \Lambda_\phi$ be an injection.  Define $\theta_\phi:W^\mathbb{M}\to \powerset\Phi \times \powerset \mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$ as follows\footnote{I am indebted to Johan van Benthem for the invention of this particular function.}
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{3in}
\begin{tabbing}
	$\theta_\phi(w) := ($ \= $\{p\in \Phi \ |\ \mathbb{M},w\VDash p\} \cup \{\rho_\phi(w)\},$\\
                       \> $\{ \bigvee \{\rho_\phi(v) \ | \ v\in W^\mathbb{M} \wedge w R^\mathbb{M}v \} \})$
\end{tabbing}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Now let $\Theta := \theta[W^\mathbb{M}]$. An induction on the complexity of subformulae $\psi$ of $\phi$ shows that 
$\mathbb{M},w\Vdash \psi \iff \Theta,\theta(w) \VDash \psi$ for all $w \in W^\mathbb{M}$.  Since 
$\mathbb{M}, w \nVdash \phi$ then we know that $\Theta,\theta(w)\nVDash \phi$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Armed with this, we can see that these semantics are adequate for modeling agents according to my declared intentions, since we have the following:
\begin{prop}\label{central-prop}
 Let $A$ be finite and define $$Th(\Omega) := \{ \phi \in \mathcal{L}(\Phi) \ |\ \Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi \textup{ for all $(a,A) \in \Omega$\}}$$
\ldots then $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \Box \phi$ if and only if $Th(\Omega) \cup A \vdash_K \phi$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 To see left to right, just note that since $A$ is finite then if $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \Box \phi$ evidently for all $(b,B)\in \Omega$ we have $\Omega, (b,B) \VDash \bigwedge A \to \phi$, which just means that $Th(\Omega) \cup A \vdash_K \phi$ by the deduction rule.

On the other hand if $Th(\Omega) \cup A \vdash_K \phi$, then we know that $Th(\Omega) \vdash_K \bigwedge A \to \phi$, and since $Th(\Omega)$ is sound for $\Omega$ we then have that for all $(b,B) \in \Omega$ that $\Omega,(b,B)\VDash \bigwedge A \to \phi$.  Since $A$ is finite we know that  $\Omega,(b,B) \VDash A$ if and only if $\Omega,(b,B) \VDash \bigwedge A$, and thus we can deduce that $\Omega,(a,A)\VDash \Box \phi$ by definition.
\end{proof}

A natural way to read $Th(\Omega)$ is the background knowledge the agent has about the universe she lives in.  This approach presents an analysis of modal logic whereby an idealized agent is modeled as closed under deduction; this is the \emph{doxastic omniscience} I have mentioned earlier. Under this view, evidently the agent's beliefs correspond to those things for which she has proofs.  This shall be the basis of my future investigations.

\subsection{The Human Condition}\label{Human-Condition}
To supplement to this basic framework, I shall try to illustrate how
further inspiration and desiderata can be drawn from the philosophical
literature.  It should be remarked that I do this in stark contrast to
the received view in epistemic logic
\citep[pg. 34]{lenzen_recent_1978}:
\begin{quote}
The search for the correct analysis of knowledge, while certainly of
extreme importance and interest to epistemology, seems not
significantly to affect the object of epistemic logic, the question of
the validity of certain epistemic-logical principles.
\end{quote}
\ldots quite to the contrary, I feel epistemic logic should not turn
it's back on philosophy. Philosophy critically provides guidance for
the intuitions behind how knowledge should be correctly modeled.  It
also provides a solid grounding in a proper treatment of knowledge.
However, engaging with philosophy is evidently not the thrust of
mainstream epistemic logic.

Most mainstream epistemic logic, the object of study is really the
nature of information, not human knowledge.  It applies equally well
to robots, \emph{homo economicus}, or thermometers as suggested in
\ref{thermometers}.  It's inspiration is not really in what it's like
to be a living person; it's more naturally based in artificial intelligence, automata
theory, algebra, topology, and other abstract disciplines.

In contrast, I propose the following principle:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{The Human Condition}: \emph{The analysis of knowledge should strive for a basis in human experience}
\end{quote}
\ldots this principle indeed underpins the Justification Principle
provided in \S\ref{explicit}. This is because I feel that the belief
in a proposition can be thought of human only if the agent has a
reason associated with it.  Otherwise, it seems that in the absence of
reason, no account can be given for how the belief came about other
than through instrumentation, which is the thermometer view.

Embracing this principle, I shall turn to the development of my
thoughts from their philosophical origins.

\subsection{Soundness}\label{soundness}
So to give a shallow example of a basic application of a philosophical
idea, it is natural to insist that if knowledge is based on beliefs
generated via deduction from some set of premises, then those premises
have to be \emph{sound}. I suggest this can be done by introducing a
new operator $\circlearrowleft$ with the following semantics:
\[ \Omega,(a,A)\VDash \circlearrowleft \iff \Omega,(a,A)\VDash A\]
Armed with these semantics, a first guess at what constitutes
knowledge suggests it might be nothing more than possession of a
belief based on a sound set of premises. So a first approximation of
knowledge might be equated with the formula:
$$\circlearrowleft \wedge \Box \phi.$$
But is this anything like an adequate analysis of knowledge?

\textbf{No}. To illustrate why I shall resort to a thought experiment to motivate why I think to the contrary.
Imagine that Charlotte suspects, correctly, that if John has tried to murder
on Alex, then Alex has survived.  She further learns, correctly, that John
has indeed tried to murder Alex.  But later, she ``learns'' some erroneous
information asserting Vietnam is south of Malaysia.  If we codify all of this as
a set $C$, and let the real world be
denoted $c$ and the universe $\Omega$, evidently we have $\Omega, (c, C) \nVDash
\circlearrowleft$, so this previous definition of knowledge fails.  But
should it?  I don't think so; Charlotte's knowledge about John's unspeakable
betrayal of Alex is correct, as well as her inference that Alex is tough as
nails.  Just because she has been deluded regarding irrelevant facts
about geography shouldn't have any bearing on her
knowledge about Alex.
\subsection{Descartes}\label{Descartes}
In reflection on the previous section, it should be remarked that
philosophers have historically been concerned with defeasible
experiential data, going back at least as early as Plato's \emph{The
  Republic VII} \citep{jowett_republic_1998}.
In answer to the problem faced by the above analysis of knowledge, I
think guidance can be found in Descartes' \emph{Meditations}
\citep{vietch_descartes_2005}.  In
\tmtextit{Meditations I}, Descartes suggests that he might be in an enlightenment era
version of \tmtextit{The Matrix} created by an all powerful demon.  In
\tmtextit{Meditations II}, he famously suggests how one might escape this
trap:
\begin{quote}
{The Meditation of yesterday has filled my mind with so many doubts,
that it is no longer in my power to forget them. Nor do I see, meanwhile, any
principle on which they can be resolved; and, just as if I had fallen all of a
sudden into very deep water, I am so greatly disconcerted as to be unable
either to plant my feet firmly on the bottom or sustain myself by swimming on
the surface. I will, nevertheless, make an effort, and try anew the same path
on which I had entered yesterday, that is, proceed by casting aside all that
admits of the slightest doubt, not less than if I had discovered it to be
absolutely false; and I will continue always in this track until I shall find
something that is certain, or at least, if I can do nothing more, until I
shall know with certainty that there is nothing certain.}\end{quote}

This tactic proposes a natural solution to the problem the previous
thought experiment: \tmtextit{Charlotte can know that Alex survives if she
 argues {\tmstrong{only}} from her experience involving Alex and John.
 }  If like Descartes she can forget some of what she has come to believe that's a
little suspicious, she might be able to compose an argument with a sound basis that Alex is alive.
 Taking Descartes as inspiration, I would suggest a new semantic operation:
\[ \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \BM \phi 
     \iff \textup{ for all }(b,B)\in \Omega
           \textup{ such that }a = b
                   \textup{ and }B \subseteq A
            \textup{ then }\Omega,(b,B) \VDash \phi \]
This mechanism lets Charlotte access subsets of her beliefs, which
would then form the basis for various arguments she might compose.
Provided that $(c,C')\in \Omega$, where $C'$ is the same as $C$ but
doesn't mention erroneous beliefs about geographical data, it might
serve as a basis for Charlotte's knowledge that Alex survives.  This
suggests that the following equation might reasonably express a more
adequate notion of knowledge:
\[ \DM(\PP \wedge \Nec \phi) \]

\subsection{Contradictions}\label{contradictions}

There's hidden virtue in the previous analysis.  To see what it is, I
am inspired by the 19th century philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, who
writes in his essay \emph{Self-Reliance} \citep{emerson_essays_2008}:
\begin{quote}
{ Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict
  somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you
  should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of
  wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of
  pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the
  thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. \ldots}

{A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
  little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a
  great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself
  with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words
  and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, 
though it contradict every thing you said to-day. 
-- `Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' -- Is it so bad
then to be misunderstood? }
\end{quote}

A healthy lack of consistency is just part of what makes up the day to
day life of any living, sane person.
Isn't error-prone reasoning a hallmark of human thought?  And if a
love sick epistemic agent $\exists$ is getting mixed signals from
another epistemic agent $\forall$, why can't she draw inconsistent
conclusions about $\forall$'s feelings on the one hand, but still have
basic knowledge that $734\times 12 = 8808$ and other such irrelevant
facts?  I don't see why not.  Under these considerations, I'd embrace
the following:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Emerson's Principle}: \emph{One can be inconsistent and still have knowledge}
\end{quote}
Permit me illustrate how the framework I have given accommodates
this. My treatment is further inspired by a friend and contemporary of
Emerson's, the poet \emph{Walt Whitman}. In \emph{Leaves of Grass}
\citep{whitman_leaves_2008}, he writes:
\begin{center}{  Do I contradict myself?\\
  Very well then I contradict myself,\\
  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)}
\end{center}
So consider the model $\Omega$ in Fig. \ref{fig:example1}; this is
intended to be a toy model of how I interpret Walt Whitman in the
above stanza. This figure should be read as follows:
\begin{bul}
 \item if one point $(a,A)$ is above another point $(b,B)$ and
   connected by a densely dotted line 
   \tikz \draw[densely dotted,semithick](0pt,0pt) -- (20pt,6pt);, 
   this means that $a = b$ and $B \subset A$.
  \item if one point $(a,A)$ is connected to another point $(b,B)$ by
    a line with an arrow \tikz \draw[->,>=latex,semithick](0pt,0pt) --
    (20pt,6pt);, this means that $\Omega,(b,B) \VDash A$
\end{bul}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[]{example1/example1.pdf}
\end{center}
%
%\caption{Inconsistent, yet still has knowledge (contains multitudes)}
\caption{Inconsistent, yet still has knowledge}
\label{fig:example1}
\end{figure}
Observe that $\Omega,(\{p\},\{p,\neg p\}) \VDash \Box \bot$; it's
obvious that in this state Walt is being inconsistent since he clearly
believes contradictory things.  Simultaneously, we have that
$\Omega,(\{p\},\{p,\neg p\}) \VDash \DM (\PP \wedge \Box p)$; so we
figure that Walt has a sound argument that $p$.  Walt might be
inconsistent, but it would appear that \emph{at least one} of his
arguments makes sense.  And this is naturally because Walt contains a
multiplicity of inner selves, just like he says, which the the $\BM$
modality gives access to.

\subsection{Irrationality}\label{irrational}

Embracing contradiction runs contrary to the received view on
epistemic logic.  For instance, \citet{hendricks_wheresbridge?_2006}
write:
\begin{quote}
{ Epistemic logic does carry epistemological significance
 but in an inevitably idealized sort of way: One restricts attention to a
class of rational agents where rationality is defined by certain
postulates. Thus, agents have to satisfy at least some minimal
conditions to simply qualify as rational. This is by and large
what Lemmon originally suggests \citep{lemmon_symposium:_1959}.}
\end{quote}
Furthermore, it is conventional to think that rational agents do not
hold contradictions.\footnote{It should be remarked that
  \citet{priest_doubt_2006} explicitly rejects this perspective on
  rationality.  Priest points out that in times of scientific
  revolution, rational people naturally hold contradictory views. He
  suggests that a paraconsistent logic framework could account for a
  rational agent holding contradictory beliefs.  I profess sympathy
  for Priest's perspective; however, I am confident that this does not
  represent the received view which I am arguing against.}  For
instance, in \citep{kraus_knowledge_1986}, $\neg \Box \bot$ is taken
as an axiom (it is A9 in their numbering).

This is similar to the thermometer concept of knowledge we provided in
\S\ref{explicit}, since like the thermometer view, it's incompatible
with a human perspective.  Hence I extend the following:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Irrationality Principle}: \emph{Since humans are not
   rational, views on epistemic logic that postulate this should be
   rejected}
\end{quote}
I should mention that while this perspective is not typically embraced
in epistemic logic\footnote{Noted exceptions to this are
  \citet{rantala_impossible_1982} and \citet{levesque_logic_1984}.},
it finds sympathy in other logical traditions, namely in
\emph{relevance logic} and \emph{paraconsistent logic}, as already
noted \citep[see][chapters 1 \& 4]{gabbay_handbook_2002}.

Apart from inconsistency, I do not really accommodate very much
irrationality; I will freely admit that frameworks like
\citep{rantala_impossible_1982} and and \citet{levesque_logic_1984}
employing \emph{impossible world} semantics are far more accommodating
to irrationality than the semantics I am proposing.  Regardless,
allowing for an agent's beliefs to
naturally be inconsistent is already orthogonal to the assumption that
agent's are rational.

\subsection{Quine}\label{quine}
I shall now return to developing my framework.  To recap, so far I
have suggested adding a novel modality $\BM$ which corresponds to
taking subsets of an agent's set of beliefs.  In the context of
conventional modal logic, this means a shift in perspective - instead
of thinking of each world as a situation where the agent can imagine
other situations, now each world corresponds to a network of beliefs
ordered by inclusion. These networks of beliefs form a poset, or
partially ordered set.  Thus the choice to visually represent them as
\emph{Hasse diagrams}, as I have done in Fig. \ref{fig:example1}, 
follows the standard practice in lattice theory. 

Furthermore, I should point out the following phenomenon - as higher
nodes in a belief network are considered, the agent is employing more
premises for the arguments they are composing, and using less pure
logic to come to conclusions.  I feel this suggests the following -
namely, that as we consider levels higher and higher in the poset of
an agent's beliefs, this sort of corresponds to embracing an agent's
experience and interpretation of their sensory data.  But arguments
that rest on more premises are prima facie more fallible than
arguments that rely on fewer assumptions.

A similar perspective has been presented before, however in a
different setting, in \emph{Two Dogmas of Empiricism}
\citep{quine_two_1951}:
\begin{quote}
{Certain statements, though about physical objects and not sense
  experience, seem peculiarly germane to sense experience -- and in a
  selective way: some statements to some experiences, others to
  others. Such statements, especially germane to particular
  experiences, I picture as near the periphery. But in this relation
  of ``germaneness'' I envisage nothing more than a loose association
  reflecting the relative likelihood, in practice, of our choosing one
  statement rather than another for revision in the event of
  recalcitrant experience. For example, we can imagine recalcitrant
  experiences to which we would surely be inclined to accommodate our
  system by re-evaluating just the statement that there are brick
  houses on Elm Street, together with related statements on the same
  topic. We can imagine other recalcitrant experiences to which we
  would be inclined to accommodate our system by re-evaluating just
  the statement that there are no centaurs, along with kindred
  statements. A recalcitrant experience can, I have already urged, be
  accommodated by any of various alternative re-evaluations in various
  alternative quarters of the total system; but, in the cases which we
  are now imagining, our natural tendency to disturb the total system
  as little as possible would lead us to focus our revisions upon
  these specific statements concerning brick houses or centaurs. These
  statements are felt, therefore, to have a sharper empirical
  reference than highly theoretical statements of physics or logic or
  ontology. \textbf{The latter statements may be thought of as
    relatively centrally located within the total network, meaning
    merely that little preferential connection with any particular
    sense data obtrudes itself.} }
\end{quote}

The emphasis on the last sentence is my addition.  The above paragraph
importantly anticipates ideas in belief revision theory (such as in
\citet{alchourron_logic_1985} and subsequent studies), as well as
recent trends in probabilistic dynamic epistemic logic \citep[such as
in][etc.]{van_benthem_conditional_2003,van_benthem_dynamic_2009,baltag_probabilistic_2008,kooi_probabilistic_2003}.
However, in the framework that I have so far been developing, what
Quine refers to as the ``periphery'' of his web of belief corresponds
to a higher node in a belief poset, while what Quine referes to as the
``center'' reflects something like a lower node.  This is visually
depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:poset}.  Beliefs that are members of lower
nodes, and the ideas that follow from them, can be thought of as
belonging to the agent's world-view.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{poset/poset2.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A network of beliefs}
\label{fig:poset}
\end{figure}

I feel the above observation informs a corresponding perspective on
epistemology.  If an agent's world view largely rested legends about
the Norse gods, I'd be reluctant to say she knows various facts about
nature, such as why lightning strikes.  This is because all of her
explanations would inevitably be based upon myths in one way or
another, which would all occupy lower nodes in her belief network.
This dictates that \emph{sanity} plays a role in how much knowledge an
agent can have - it is permissible to grant that an inconsistent agent
has knowledge provided that the inconsistency follows only shallowly
from her experiential data, and it is something she would readily give
up.  However, if a contradiction is intrinsic to the agent's
psychology, and thus follows from a lower node in her belief poset, my
analysis suggests she doesn't really have knowledge.  So while I
believe that irrational agents can possess knowledge, as I have argued
in \S\ref{irrational}, I do not contend that they \emph{always} posses
knowledge. Moreover, I hold that the sort of irrationality that I am
considering needn't be superficial - both mundane as well as deeply
demented characters can be modeled.

I'll admit that the above essentially presents my own interpretation
of Quine's web of belief, which might be contentious.  On the other
hand, I feel both the quote from Quine and the quote from Whitman in
\S\ref{contradictions} suggest the following principle without too
much controversy:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Quine/Whitman Principle}: \emph{Epistemic agents are compound
   entities, which invite compositional analysis.}
\end{quote}
The above presents the final philosophical principle that I intend to
extend.  Apart from this, I would say from the previous discussion, I
would like to extract an additional thing:  Figure \ref{fig:poset}
naturally suggests that we might think of \emph{going up} in a belief
net, in a manner similar to how $\BM$ allows one to \emph{go down} as
I suggested in \S\ref{Descartes}. Along these lines, I would suggest
the introduction of a new operator $\BP$.  The semantics for $\BP$ are
given as follows:
\[ \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \BP \phi \iff \textup{ for all }
(b,B)\in\Omega\textup{ if } b = a \textup{ and } A\subseteq B \textup{
  then } \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \phi \]
Just as $\BM$ corresponds to the agent casting assumptions into doubt,
or disregarding their premises, $\BP$ corresponds to the agent
embracing their experience, suspending disbelief and accepting her
intuitions and senses.

This essentially concludes the sketch of novelties I propose in the
practice of modelling knowledge.

\subsection{Closing Remarks}
\label{close}
The various principles extended in the previous sections are not
independent - some of them are more basic than others.  Their
relationship is summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:principles} - here the
lower a principle is depicted, the more basic I feel it is.  Dotted
lines indicate that I feel the philosophical justification for the
higher principle supervenes on the justification of the lower
principle.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{principles/principles.pdf} 
\end{center}
\caption{A visualization of the relationship of the principles I have suggested}
\label{fig:principles}
\end{figure}
In addition, in further development of the framework sketched in \S\ref{explicit}, I shall want the following criteria, based on my ideas given in relevant sections:
\begin{description}
 \item[\S\ref{explicit}] \begin{bul}
                          \item Agents shall be modelled with proofs for the things they believe.
			  \item To avoid paradoxes, correct
                            foundations must be provided.  Idealy, I
                            would like my semantics to correspond to a
                            provably terminating computation, granting
                            certain non-deterministic operations such
                            as a  \emph{choice operator}
                            $\varepsilon$, as described in
                            \citep{hilbert_neubegrndung_1922}.
                         \end{bul}
  \item[] For a set of beliefs $A$:
\begin{description}
  \item[\S\ref{soundness}] It should be expressible whether everything in $A$ is sound 
  \item[\S\ref{Descartes}] Certain subsets $B\subseteq A$ should be accessible
  \item[\S\ref{quine}] Certain extensions $B \supseteq A$ could also be accessed
\end{description}
\end{description}
In line with evidentialist epistemology, as mentioned in
\S\ref{sketch}, I have decided to call the logic I shall develop
\emph{Evidentialist Logic}, or \textsc{EviL} for brevity.

\section{Introduction to \textsc{EviL}}\label{evil-semantics}
%\subsection{Forward}
With the philosophical intuitions and scaffolding provided from
\S\ref{philosophy}, I shall now turn to giving a precise account of my previously
developed ideas.  This shall be done in three movements:
\begin{description}
 \item[\S\ref{basic-evil}]  In the first section I will provide the
   basic grammar and semantics for \textsc{EviL} with a single agent;
   the presentation in this section will remain primarily
   philosophical and light.
 \item[\S\ref{dead-by-dawn}]  In the second section I develop several
   topics in the pure theory of \textsc{EviL} which I consider a bit
   beyond the bare essentials.
  \item[\S\ref{army-of-darkness}]  In this section, completeness and
    decidability is discussed in relation to \textsc{EviL} and two sublogics.
\end{description}

% from that section provided by the previous section into a provide an outline
% for the basic grammar and semantics of \textsc{EviL}. I also try to develop
% intuitions about how I personally read these semantics, and provide examples of
% various validities.
