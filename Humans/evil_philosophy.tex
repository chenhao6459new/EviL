\section{Philosophy}\label{philosophy}
\subsection{Forward}

The idea of applying modal logic to the study of knowledge more or
less began with \citet[\emph{Knowledge and Belief},
by]{hintikka_knowledge_1969}.  In this it is suggested that one can
use the possible world framework of modal logic to model ideal logical
agents, and reason about concepts like knowledge and belief as modal
boxes.  In Hintikka's text, some philosophical emphasis is put on the ideas of
\emph{introspection}, which have two formulations:

\begin{bul}
	\item Positive: $\Box \phi \to \Box\Box \phi$ - ``If the agent knows a fact, then she knows that she knows this.''
	\item Negative: $\Pos \phi \to \Box\Pos \phi$ - ``If the agent does not know a fact, she knows that she does not know this.''
\end{bul}

Intuitively, the second idea seems like something one ought to reject
outright.  Many will recall the somewhat famous piece of sophistry put
forward by former US secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld
\citep{rumsfeld_defense.gov_2002}:
\begin{quote}
Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting
to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we
know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we
know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown
unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks
throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is
the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.\end{quote}

This quote was ultimately part of a rather hideous 
justification for criminal military action.  Still, it is undeniably
at variance with negative introspection; and despite its malicious
intent, it is compelling.  Like Rumsfeld, Hintikka also
rejects negative introspection.  Furthermore, it would seem from the above
quote that Rumsfeld does not reject positive introspection. Hintikka
does not either, and goes one step further to endorse it explicitly.

Despite philosophical objections, the received view in modern
epistemic logic embraces both negative and positive introspection.  In
addition, the following axiom is also embraced:
\begin{bul}
	\item Reflection: $\Box \phi \to \phi$ - ``If the agent knows a some statement, that statement is true''
\end{bul}
These three axioms together, along with the axioms and rules of
elementary modal logic, form C.I. Lewis' system $S5$
\citep{lewis_symbolic_1951}.  Under correspondence theory, these
axioms express that the underlying modal accessibility relation is an
equivalence relation. That is, they express that the ideal agent under
investigation has partitioned her state space into \emph{information
  states}.  It is well known that game theory shares an equivalent
notion of information states (see, for instance,
\citet{halpern_set-theoretic_1999} and \citet[chapter
3]{rubinstein_modeling_1998}).

Although this view of knowledge has been the focus of exhaustive
research, even finding industrial application such as in \citet{agray_ban_2002} and
\citet{hommersom_toward_2005,hommersom_update_2004}, it is natural for
a practitioner to hold lingering philosophical concerns.  The purpose
of this thesis is to present a framework which tries to address some
of these issues.  It shall conform to the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\S\ref{philosophy}] First, we shall elaborate the
    philosophical issues that will be addressed, and sketch an epistemic
    logic framework which tackles them
    \item[\S\ref{evil-semantics}] Next, we give formal details of the
      system we will develop.  This section climaxes in the exposition
      of a completeness theorem.
  \item[\S\ref{applications}]  Third, we shall look at philosophical
    applications of the framework developed.  It shall be revealed that
    \emph{intuitionistic logic} is profoundly linked to the
    perspective on epistemic logic we shall investigate here.
  % \item[\S\ref{robots}]  Here, I discuss a side project I carried out
  %   where I formalized the weak completeness theorem of
  %   \S\ref{evil-semantics} in the computer proof
  %   assistant Isabelle/HOL.  
  %   % I did this principally because the proof was sufficiently
  %   % challenging that I held many personal doubts of its correctness.
  %   This section is intended to showcase how computer assisted verification can be
  %   used as a vehicle for over-coming conceptual difficulties in mathematics.
  \item[\S\ref{epilogue}]  Finally, the framework developed shall be
    compared to other approaches.
\end{itemize}

That being said, we shall now turn to investigating the philosophical
issues with epistemic logic, and suggest a manner of addressing them.

\subsection{Thermometers}\label{thermometers}

Imagine a 1 m$^3$ box with a thermometer sealed hermetically inside,
as in Fig.  \ref{fig:therm1}.  Further, pretend that the thermometer
reads 290 Kelvin.  How many moles of gas are in the chamber?

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{thermometer.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A thermometer in a box}
\label{fig:therm1}
\end{figure}

The answer is indeterminate.  Recall the \emph{ideal gas law}, originally discovered by \'{E}mile Clapeyon
\citep{clapeyron_mmoire_1834}, which in modern parlance it reads:
\[ P V = n R T\]
Where:
\begin{bul}
\item $P$ is the pressure in Pascals
\item $V$ is the volume in cubic meters
\item $n$ is the number of moles of gas
\item $T$ is the temperature in Kelvins
\item $R$ is the \emph{ideal gas constant}, $\approx 8.3$
  J$\cdot$K$^{-1}\cdot$mol$^{-1}$
\end{bul}

Applying the ideal gas law, one can observe that the thermometer is effectively
in something analogous to an epistemic space.  To be explicit,
consider a basic modal language with the following grammar \label{Ltherm}$\mathcal{L}_{\textup{therm}}$:
\[ \phi ::= x \textup{ Pascals}  \ |\ y \textup{ moles}  \ |\ z \textup{ Kelvin}  \ |\ \phi \to \psi \ |\ \bot \ |\ \Box \phi \]

Interpreting this language appropriately, the
thermometer is evidently an epistemic agent in an $S5$ model.
One model for the thermometer-in-a-box is the triple $\langle W, V, \sim \rangle$,
where:
\begin{bul}
	\item $W$ is pairs $(P,n)$ where $P$ is some positive pressure
          in Pascals and $n$ is some positive number of moles.
	\item $V$ is defined as follows:
	\begin{bul}
		\item $(P,n) \in V(x \textup{\ Pascals})$ if $P = x$
		\item $(P,n) \in V(y \textup{\ moles})$ if $n = y$
		\item $(P,n) \in V(z \textup{\ Kelvin})$ if $z = \frac{P}{n \cdot R}$
	\end{bul}
	\item Finally, $(P,n) \sim (P',n')$ holds if and only if $P \cdot n' = P' \cdot n$ 
\end{bul}
\ref{fig:therm2} provides a visual representation of the information
states in the above model, which form rays emanating from the origin.

The view in philosophy of mind that thermometers are epistemic agents 
originates Daniel Dennet's \emph{The Intentional Stance}
\citep{dennett_intentional_1998}, 
with the proviso that Dennett's
original discussion originates around thermostats rather than 
thermometers as we have argued.  Dennett writes:
\begin{quote}
\emph{It is not that we attribute (or should attribute) beliefs and desires only to
things in which we find internal representations, but rather that when we
discover some object for which the intentional strategy works, we endeavor to
interpret some of its internal states or processes as internal representations.
What makes some internal feature of a thing a representation could only be its
role in regulating the behavior of an intentional system.}

Now the reason for stressing our kinship with the thermostat
should be clear. There is no magic moment in the transition from a
simple thermostat to a system that really has an internal representation
of the world around it. The thermostat has a minimally demanding
representation of the world, fancier thermostats have more demanding 
representations of the world, fancier robots for helping around
the house would have still more demanding representations of the
world. Finally you reach us.
\end{quote}

% Now, I give this example because it is representative of the
% perspective provided by epistemic logic - agents are essentially
% elaborate \emph{sensor networks} in the received view.  
The aim of epistemic logic is to model agents modeling the world; and
in doing so its development mirrors the increasing levels of
complexity that Dennett illustrates.  To give an exemplar of the
modern level of sophistication achieved by epistemic logic, consider
probablistic dynamic epistemic logic as developed in \citep{van_benthem_dynamic_2009}.

Moreover, just as thinking about thermostats serves as a vehicle for
philosophy of mind for Daniel Dennett, thinking about
thermometers can elucidate intuitions behind basic epistemic logic,
and how it might be extended.
Imagine we were to go up to one of the agents modeled in basic
epistemic logic, and ask her why she knows some
proposition $\phi$. What would she possibly say?  She would say she feels
$\phi$ with every fiber of her being, that it is true in every
world she can conceive.  The reason that $\phi$ occurs to
the agent is because it is what her sensory instruments (modeled as her
accessibility relations) tell her.   In this respect, the analogy of
the thermometer seems pretty apt.
%Indeed, thermometers appear to be rather representative as agents under
%the theory of basic epistemic logic.
%This is exactly the same as the way the thermometer was modeled in the previous thought experiment. 
%To this end I shall abbreviate the received view on epistemic logic as the
%\emph{thermometer theory of knowledge}.

Some natural philosophical features of knowledge 
cannot be captured by this basic approach.
If we were to ask a person on the street why she believes a
proposition $\phi$, an appeal that she cannot imagine or
conceive of the contrary as possible would not slake our curiousity.
We typically want some kind of
\emph{explanation}, especially if $\phi$ were a piece of mathematics, for
instance.  It would certainly make the enterprise of mathematics far
simpler if proving theorems amounted to exhibiting that their negation
is not imaginable. This gives rise to the following philosophical observation:
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Anti-Thermometer Principle}: \emph{Traditional epistemic agents,
  like thermometers, don't always have knowledge, since one must
  sometimes have reasons for the things they believe.}
\end{quote}

How might epistemic logic be saved by the objection that the above
principle proposes?  To find out, we turn to diagnosing the
underpinning of the above principle.
%To address the issue with epistemic logic raised by the above principle, 
%As I will elaborate, the above assertion follows from more general concerns I have with epistemic logic.

\caption{Thermometer information states}
\label{fig:therm2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Explicit Justification}\label{explicit}

I hold that the \emph{Anti-Thermometer Principle} is an expression of
the following more fundamental idea:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Justification Principle}: \emph{In order to know something,
   one must sometimes demonstrate inferential justification.}
\end{quote}

% I contend that derivation in a logical calculus is suitable
% justification for the above principle. In light of this, all of my
% future developments shall center around the idea that in order to have
% knowledge, one must have a special derivation.  Since knowledge
% entails belief \citep[under the traditional view in]{gettier_is_1963},
% I have decided to simply equate belief with having a derivation.
% Hence knowledge can then be thought of a species of this kind of
% derivational belief. And while it is perhaps as bad an
% oversimplification as the thermometer view I have previously
% criticized, my modeling technique assumes \emph{doxastic omniscience},
% which is to say that I assume an agent's beliefs are closed under
% logical consequence\footnote{\cite{hintikka_knowledge_1969} assumes a
%   similar perspective; for modeling purposes, the agent is assumed to
%   have adequate time to realize the consequences of their beliefs.
%   Simlarly, we might interpret belief as what is refered to in
%   \citet{levesque_logic_1984} as ``implicit belief.''}.  This will
%   be illustrated shortly.

Demanding the \emph{Justification Principle} is tantamount to demanding
a sort of \emph{explicit justification} for beliefs in epistemic
logic. This particular desiderata 
been suggested previously. The hunt for logics of
explicit justification was initiated in
\citet{van_benthem_reflectionsepistemic_1991}\footnote{While this
  paper is considered seminal, it should be remarked that research
  into this subject began prior to it.  Specifically, the
  phrase ``explicit belief'' appears to have its origins in
  \citep{levesque_logic_1984}.}. One framework which has been proposed
to achieve this is \emph{Justification Logic}
\citep{artemov_introducing_2005,artemov_justification_2007,fitting_logic_2004,fitting_logic_2005}.
Alternative frameworks for reasoning about implicit/explicit
information have also been proposed in \citet{van_benthem_inference_2009} and
\citet{velzquez-quesada_inference_2009}.

In this text we shall investigate a novel framework in this line of research, in the hopes of
offering further response that practitioners of epistemic logic may
exhort in answer to the problems raised by the aforementioned 
\emph{justification principle}.  
To model beliefs with justifications, we shall modify the semantics of
modal logic to incorporate  certain \emph{basic beliefs}, which we
should interpret as non-inferentially  justified.  
These basic beliefs then inferentially generate the rest  of what the
agent believes.

This perspective amounts to what is called 
\emph{classical foundationalism} in the philosophical literature.  
Richard
Fumerton describes the view as follows:

\begin{quote}
[A] foundationalist is someone who claims that there are 
noninferentially justified beliefs and that all justified 
beliefs owe their justification, ultimately, in part, to the 
existence of noninferentially justified beliefs\footnote{In the
  proceeding discussion, we shall refer 
 to \emph{noninferentially justified beliefs} as \emph{basic
   beliefs} or premises.}.  
A belief is  noninferentially justified if its justification is not constituted 
by the having of other justified beliefs. \citep[pg. 3]{depaul_resurrecting_2001}
\end{quote}

The view presented would not deny that thermometers or
traditional epistemic agents have knowledge, no more than it would
deny that one has knowledge of that her right hand has five fingers
attached to the end. Rather, our aim is to try to modify the semantics 
of epistemic logic, more specifically \emph{doxastic logic}, 
with the ingredients for a foundationalist analysis of knowledge.  As
will be demonstrated, this can be done without modifying the basic modal
logic syntax. % traditionally used in epistemic logic.
%My approach will make use of off-the-shelf syntax of modal logic.

\subsection{Sketch}\label{sketch}

%These analyses mentioned in the previous section are all quite
%sophisticated; I have in mind something comparatively na\"{i}ve.  
In this section we shall see a very informal presentation of the
basic elements which shall compose the forthcoming analysis.  
A formal development of the ideas sketched in this section shall be 
given in \S\ref{evil-grammar}.  With this proviso, consider the basic
modal language \label{LK}$\mathcal{L}_K(\Phi)$:
\[ \phi ::= p \in \Phi \ |\ \phi \to \psi \ | \ \bot \ |\ \Box \phi \]

Further, let $\Omega \subseteq \powerset \Phi \times \powerset
\mathcal{L}_K(\Phi)$, that is, let $\Omega$ be pairs of sets of letters
and formulae. Define the following truth predicate $\VDash$
recursively:

\par
\begin{minipage}[h]{\linewidth}
\begin{definition}\label{basicsemantics}\  
\begin{empt}
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash p \iff p \in a$
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi \to \psi \iff \Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi$ implies $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \psi$
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \bot \iff False$
 \item $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \Box \phi \iff $ for all $(b,B) \in
   \Omega$, $\Omega,(b,B) \VDash A$ implies $\Omega, (b,B)\VDash \phi$
%   for all $(b,B) \in \Omega$
\end{empt}
\end{definition}
\end{minipage}

\par 
Since the semantics like the above shall be the principle objects of
study, we will give how to read them philosophically.  In these
semantics, instead of thinking of every world individually, we think of
every world as containing facts and a part of the agent's mind.  
This part of the agent's mind is represented by what we shall refer to as
propositions which she ascents to. We shall refer to these
interchangeably as \emph{premises}, \emph{assumptions}, \emph{basic
  beliefs}, \emph{experiences}, or \emph{evidence}.  These sets of
propositions also represent, in a way, the agent's \emph{frame of
  mind}; we shall return to developing this perspective in
\S\ref{irrational}. For now we will stick to the former readings.

 To understand $\box \phi$, we think of the agent as producing
 derivations in a logical calculus on the basis of her evidence.  
 So we alternately read  as \emph{the agent believes $phi$}, 
 \emph{the agent can deduce $\phi$} or
 \emph{can compose an argument for $\phi$}.  We shall make further
 reference to this reading explicitly again in \S. 
 
 Like the original formulation of epistemic
 logic in \cite{hintikka_knowledge_1969}, we assume that 
 agents are \emph{doxastically omniscient} - that is they 
 believe all of the consequences of their beliefs.  We shall 
 prefer to think of this particular idealization as thinking about 
 what an agent might conclude \emph{eventually}.

 By focusing on basic items of evidence as forming the foundation for
 belief, we consider this approach to be roughly in line with the 
 \emph{evidentialist} view on  epistemology, which may be described as follows:
 \begin{quote}
  [E]videntialism is a supervenience thesis according to which facts
  about whether or not a person is justified in believing a
  proposition supervene on facts describing the evidence that the
  person has. \citet[pg. 5]{conee_evidentialism_2004}
 \end{quote}
 However, while our sympathies are with this perspective on
 epistemology, they differ foundationally - while evidentialism
 develops intuitions using analytical philosophy, our approach shall be
 founded in formal semantics like the one above.

As alluded to in \S\ref{thermometers}, we shall read $\Pos \phi$ as
\emph{the agent can conceive that $\phi$} or \emph{the agent can
  imagine $\phi$ being possible}.  The former is the standard reading
in epistemic logic (see, for instance, \cite{meyer_epistemic_1995}).  In general, we shall prefer to read $\Pos$ as
in terms of \emph{imagination}.  

That is, if a proper foundation can be provided at all.  Admittedly,
the above formulation of truth immediately runs into a \emph{paradox}
- for instance, let 
\begin{bul}
\item $a:=\varnothing$ 
\item $A:=\{\Box \bot\}$
\item and $\Omega:= \{(a,A)\}$
\end{bul}
Under this assignment,  $\Omega,(a,A)\VDash \Box \bot$ has no
determinate truth value.  So let $\mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$ be the 
propositional fragment of $\mathcal{L}_K$, with the following grammar\label{Lang0}:
\[ \phi\ {::=} \  p \in \Phi \ |\ \phi \to \psi \ | \ \bot \]
We shall restrict the truth value to 
$\Omega\subseteq \Phi \times \powerset \mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$.
This suffices to make every truth value of this logic determinate.

We may observe that the logic of these semantics is familiar:
\begin{prop}
Assuming that the set of proposition letters $\Phi$ is infinite
$$\vdash_{K} \phi\textup{ if and only if } \Omega, (a,A) \VDash \phi \textup{ for all finite $\Omega$ for all $(a,A) \in \Omega$}$$
Here $K$ is basic modal logic.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 Left to right is trivial, so we shall focus on right to left.  Assume
 that $\nvdash_{K} \phi$, then we know from completeness and the
 finite model property that there's some finite model
 $\mathbb{M}=\langle W, V, R \rangle$ and world $w \in W$ such that $\mathbb{M},w \nVdash \phi$ (see \citet[chapters 2 \& 4]{blackburn_modal_2001} for details of these facts).

Now let $PropVars_\phi$ be the proposition letters that occur as
subformulae of $\phi$, and let $q : W
\hookrightarrow \Phi \bs PropVars_\phi$ be an injection. In
  other words $q$ assigns \emph{fresh letters} to worlds in the
  model \footnote{ In
  this vein, we shall abbreviate $q(w)$ as $q_w$. Note
  that because $PropVars_\phi$ are \emph{finite} and $\Phi$ is assumed
to be \emph{infinite}, such an inject always exists.  This is a
consequence of \emph{The Axiom of Choice}.}.  Define
$\theta:W^\mathbb{M}\to \powerset\Phi \times \powerset
\mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$ as follows
%\footnote{I am indebted to Johan van Benthem for the invention of this particular function.}
$$ \theta(x) := (\{p\in \Phi \ |\ \mathbb{M},w\VDash p\} \cup
\{q_w\}, \{ \bigvee_{v \in R[w]} q_v  \} ) $$
% \begin{center}
% \begin{minipage}{3in}
% \begin{tabbing}
% 	$\theta_\phi(w) := ($ \= \hspace{-.25cm} $\{p\in \Phi \ |\ \mathbb{M},w\VDash p\} \cup \{q_w\},$\\
%                        \> \hspace{-.25cm} $\{ \bigvee_{v \in R^\mathbb{M}[w]} q_v  \} )$
% \end{tabbing}
% \end{minipage}
% \end{center}

Now let $\Theta := \theta[W]$. An induction on the complexity of subformulae $\psi$ of $\phi$ shows that 
$\mathbb{M},w\Vdash \psi \iff \Theta,\theta(w) \VDash \psi$ for all $w \in W^\mathbb{M}$.  Since 
$\mathbb{M}, w \nVdash \phi$ then we know that $\Theta,\theta(w)\nVDash \phi$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Intuitively, the idea behind the above construction is to label all of the
worlds with fresh letters, and then construct a special formula from these
fresh letters for each world.  The extension of each of these formulae is, in every case,
exactly the worlds the agent could have accessed with the
accessibility relation.  A far more elaborate construction, based on
the similar principles, shall be presented in \S\ref{translation}.

Armed with this, we can see that these semantics are adequate for
modeling agents according to our declared intentions.
Recall the following definitions from basic logic and modal model
theory\footnote{This notation consciously imitates the notation
  employed in \citep{blackburn_modal_2001}.}:
\begin{mydef}\label{basicdefs}
\begin{mynum}
\item\label{basicdefsI} For any model $\Omega$, define $Th(\Omega)$:
\[Th(\Omega) := \{ \phi \in \mathcal{L}_K(\Phi) \ |\ \Omega, (a,A)
\VDash \phi \textup{ for all $(a,A) \in \Omega$}\}\]
$Th(\Omega)$ is called \textbf{the theory of $\Omega$}.

\item\label{basicdefsII} $A \subseteq_\omega B$ means that $A$ is a finite subset of $B$

\item\label{basicdefsIII} Define $\Gamma \vdash_K \phi$ to mean:
\[ \vdash_K \bigwedge \Delta \to \phi \textup{ for some $\Delta
  \subseteq_\omega \Gamma$} \]
If $\Gamma \vdash \phi$, we say that $\phi$ is \textbf{derivable from
  $\Gamma$}.
\end{mynum}
\end{mydef}

The following theorem equates belief in at a world in a model with
possession of a derivation:
\begin{prop}\label{central-prop}
 For all $A\subseteq_\omega \mathcal{L}_0(\Phi)$, then $\Omega, (a,A) \VDash \Box \phi$ if and only if $Th(\Omega) \cup A \vdash_K \phi$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The proof of the above hinges on two basic facts.  The first is the
\emph{deduction theorem} (provided that $B$ is finite):
\begin{equation}
A \cup B \vdash_K \phi \iff A \vdash_K \bigwedge B \to \phi \label{eq:deduction-theorem}
\end{equation}
The above follows from Definition
\ref{basicdefs} part \ref{basicdefsIII}, and is one of the standard results in
modal logic.

The next observation is also rather basic:
\begin{equation}
Th(\Omega) \vdash_K \phi \iff \phi \in Th(\Omega) \label{eq:omegabasic}
\end{equation}
The proof of this follows from the fact that if $\vdash_K \phi$ then
$\phi \in Th(\Omega)$, and $Th(\Omega)$ can be observed to be  closed under modus ponens.

So assume that $A \subseteq_\omega
\mathcal{L}_0$. With the above key facts we have the following chain
of reasoning:
\begin{align*}
  Th(\Omega) \cup A \vdash_K \phi & \iff   Th(\Omega) \vdash \bigwedge A
  \to \phi 
   & \textup{by \eqref{eq:deduction-theorem}} 
\\
 & \iff \bigwedge A \to \phi \in Th(\Omega) & \textup{by
   \eqref{eq:omegabasic}} \\
 & \iff \Omega, (b,B) \VDash \bigwedge A \to \phi \textup{ for all
   $(b,B) \in Th(\Omega)$} & \textup{by Def. \ref{basicdefs} part
   \ref{basicdefsI}} \\
 & \iff \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \Box \phi \textup{ for any $a$ where
   $(a,A) \in \Omega$} & \textup{by Def. \ref{basicsemantics}}
\end{align*}
These equivalences suffice to prove the result.
\end{proof}

A natural way to read $Th(\Omega)$ is the background knowledge the agent has about the universe she lives in.  This approach presents an analysis of modal logic whereby an idealized agent is modeled as closed under deduction; this is the \emph{doxastic omniscience} mentioned previously. Under this view, evidently the agent's beliefs correspond to those things for which she has proofs.  This shall be the basis of our future investigations.

\subsection{The Human Condition}\label{Human-Condition}
To supplement to this basic framework, it shall be illustrated how
further inspiration can be drawn from a philosophical
perspective.  This is in stark contrast to
the received view in epistemic logic
\citep[pg. 34]{lenzen_recent_1978}:
\begin{quote}
The search for the correct analysis of knowledge, while certainly of
extreme importance and interest to epistemology, seems not
significantly to affect the object of epistemic logic, the question of
the validity of certain epistemic-logical principles.
\end{quote}
Quite to the contrary, we urge that epistemic logic should not turn
its back on philosophy. Philosophy critically provides guidance for
the intuitions behind how knowledge should be correctly modeled.  It
also provides a solid grounding in a proper treatment of knowledge.
However, engaging with philosophy is evidently not the thrust of
mainstream epistemic logic.

Most mainstream epistemic logic, the object of study is really the
nature of information, not human knowledge.  It applies equally well
to robots, \emph{homo economicus}, or thermometers as suggested in
\ref{thermometers}.  Its inspiration is not really in what it is like
to be a living person; it is more naturally based in artificial
intelligence, information theory, automata theory, algebra, topology,
and other abstract disciplines.

In contrast, we shall propose the following principle:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{The Human Condition}: \emph{The analysis of knowledge should strive for a basis in human experience}
\end{quote}
The above principle indeed underpins the justification principle
provided in \S\ref{explicit}. This is because we feel that the belief
in a proposition can be thought of human only if the agent has a
reason associated with it.  Otherwise, it seems that in the absence of
reason, no account can be given for how the belief came about other
than through instrumentation, which is the thermometer view.

By embracing the human condition, we shall now turn to the development
of the logical perspective on knowledge extended here from its philosophical origins.

\subsection{Soundness}\label{soundness}
So to give a shallow example of a basic application of a philosophical
idea, it is natural to insist that if knowledge is based on beliefs
generated via deduction from some set of premises, then those premises
have to be \emph{sound}. This can be done by introducing a
new operator $\circlearrowleft$ with the following semantics:
\[ \Omega,(a,A)\VDash \circlearrowleft \iff \Omega,(a,A)\VDash A\]
Armed with these semantics, a first guess at what constitutes
knowledge suggests it might be nothing more than possession of a
belief based on a sound set of premises. So a first approximation of
knowledge might be equated with the formula:
$$\circlearrowleft \wedge \Box \phi.$$
But is this anything like an adequate analysis of knowledge?

\textbf{No}. To illustrate why, let us consider a thought
experiment.
Imagine that Charlotte suspects, correctly, that if John has tried to murder
on Alex, then Alex has survived.  She further learns, correctly, that John
has indeed tried to murder Alex.  But later, she ``learns'' some erroneous
information asserting Vietnam is south of Malaysia.  If we codify all of this as
a set $C$, and let the real world be
denoted $c$ and the universe $\Omega$, evidently we have $\Omega, (c, C) \nVDash
\circlearrowleft$, so this previous definition of knowledge fails.  But
should it?  This is doubtful; Charlotte's knowledge about John's unspeakable
betrayal of Alex is correct, as well as her inference that Alex is tough as
nails.  Just because she has been deluded regarding irrelevant facts
about geography shouldn't have any bearing on her
knowledge about Alex.
\subsection{Descartes}\label{Descartes}
In reflection on the previous section, it should be remarked that
philosophers have historically been concerned with defeasible
experiential data, going back at least as early as Plato's \emph{The
  Republic VII} \citep{jowett_republic_1998}.
In answer to the problem faced by the above analysis of knowledge, guidance can be found in Descartes' \emph{Meditations}
\citep{vietch_descartes_2005}.  In
\tmtextit{Meditations I}, Descartes suggests that he might be in an enlightenment era
version of \tmtextit{The Matrix} created by an all powerful demon.  In
\tmtextit{Meditations II}, he famously suggests how one might escape this
trap:
\begin{quote}
{The Meditation of yesterday has filled my mind with so many doubts,
that it is no longer in my power to forget them. Nor do I see, meanwhile, any
principle on which they can be resolved; and, just as if I had fallen all of a
sudden into very deep water, I am so greatly disconcerted as to be unable
either to plant my feet firmly on the bottom or sustain myself by swimming on
the surface. I will, nevertheless, make an effort, and try anew the same path
on which I had entered yesterday, that is, proceed by casting aside all that
admits of the slightest doubt, not less than if I had discovered it to be
absolutely false; and I will continue always in this track until I shall find
something that is certain, or at least, if I can do nothing more, until I
shall know with certainty that there is nothing
certain.}\citep[\emph{Meditations II}]{vietch_descartes_2005}\end{quote}

This tactic proposes a natural solution to the problem the previous
thought experiment: \tmtextit{Charlotte can know that Alex survives if she
 argues {\tmstrong{only}} from her experience involving Alex and John.
 }  If like Descartes she can forget some of what she has come to believe that's a
little suspicious, she might be able to compose an argument with a sound basis that Alex is alive.
 Taking Descartes as inspiration, we might think of a novel semantic operation:
\[ \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \BM \phi 
     \iff \textup{ for all }(b,B)\in \Omega
           \textup{ such that }a = b
                   \textup{ and }B \subseteq A
            \textup{ then }\Omega,(b,B) \VDash \phi \]
This mechanism lets Charlotte access subsets of her beliefs, which
would then form the basis for various arguments she might compose.
Provided that $(c,C')\in \Omega$, where $C'$ is the same as $C$ but
doesn't mention erroneous beliefs about geographical data, it might
serve as a basis for Charlotte's knowledge that Alex survives.  This
suggests that the following equation might reasonably express a more
adequate notion of knowledge:
\[ \DM(\PP \wedge \Nec \phi) \]

\subsection{Contradictions}\label{contradictions}

There's hidden virtue in the previous analysis.  To see what it is,
inspiration can be found in the 19th century philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, who
writes in his essay \emph{Self-Reliance} \citep{emerson_essays_2008}:
\begin{quote}
{ Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict
  somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you
  should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of
  wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of
  pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the
  thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. \ldots}

{A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
  little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a
  great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself
  with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words
  and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, 
though it contradict every thing you said to-day. 
-- `Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' -- Is it so bad
then to be misunderstood? }
\end{quote}

A healthy lack of consistency is just part of what makes up the day to
day life of any living, sane person.
Isn't error-prone reasoning a hallmark of human thought?  And if a
love sick epistemic agent $\exists$ is getting mixed signals from
another epistemic agent $\forall$, why can't she draw inconsistent
conclusions about $\forall$'s feelings on the one hand, but still have
basic knowledge that $734\times 12 = 8808$ and other such irrelevant
facts?  There is no compelling reason why not.  Under these
considerations, the following is compelling:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Emerson's Principle}: \emph{One can be inconsistent and still have knowledge}
\end{quote}
We may observe how the framework so far developed accommodates this.
We may draw further inspiration by a friend and contemporary of
Emerson's, the poet Walt Whitman. In \emph{Leaves of Grass}
\citep{whitman_leaves_2008}, he writes:
\begin{center}{  Do I contradict myself?\\
  Very well then I contradict myself,\\
  (I am large, I contain multitudes.)}
\end{center}
So consider the model $\Omega$ in Fig. \ref{fig:example1}; this is
intended to be a toy model of how one might interpret Walt Whitman in the
above stanza. This figure should be read as follows:
\begin{bul}
 \item if one point $(a,A)$ is above another point $(b,B)$ and
   connected by a densely dotted line 
   \tikz \draw[densely dotted,semithick](0pt,0pt) -- (20pt,6pt);, 
   this means that $a = b$ and $B \subset A$.
  \item if one point $(a,A)$ is connected to another point $(b,B)$ by
    a line with an arrow \tikz \draw[->,>=latex,semithick](0pt,0pt) --
    (20pt,6pt);, this means that $\Omega,(b,B) \VDash A$
\end{bul}
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[]{example1/example1.pdf}
\end{center}
%
%\caption{Inconsistent, yet still has knowledge (contains multitudes)}
\caption{Inconsistent, yet still has knowledge}
\label{fig:example1}
\end{figure}
Observe that $\Omega,(\{p\},\{p,\neg p\}) \VDash \Box \bot$; it's
obvious that in this state Walt is being inconsistent since he clearly
believes contradictory things.  Simultaneously, we have that
$\Omega,(\{p\},\{p,\neg p\}) \VDash \DM (\PP \wedge \Box p)$; so we
figure that Walt has a sound argument that $p$.  Walt might be
inconsistent, but it would appear that \emph{at least one} of his
arguments makes sense.  And this is naturally because Walt contains a
multiplicity of inner selves, just like he says, which the the $\BM$
modality gives access to.

\subsection{Irrationality}\label{irrational}

Embracing contradiction runs contrary to the received view on
epistemic logic.  For instance, \citet{hendricks_wheresbridge?_2006}
write:
\begin{quote}
{ Epistemic logic does carry epistemological significance
 but in an inevitably idealized sort of way: One restricts attention to a
class of rational agents where rationality is defined by certain
postulates. Thus, agents have to satisfy at least some minimal
conditions to simply qualify as rational. This is by and large
what Lemmon originally suggests \citep{lemmon_symposium:_1959}.}
\end{quote}
Furthermore, it is conventional to think that rational agents do not
hold contradictions.\footnote{It should be remarked that
  \citet{priest_doubt_2006} explicitly rejects this perspective on
  rationality.  Priest points out that in times of scientific
  revolution, rational people naturally hold contradictory views. He
  suggests that a paraconsistent logic framework could account for a
  rational agent holding contradictory beliefs.  While our hearts are
  indeed sympathetic to Priest's perspective, we are
  nonetheless confident that this does not
  represent the received view which we are attacking.}  For
instance, in \citep{kraus_knowledge_1986}, $\neg \Box \bot$ is taken
as an axiom (it is A9 in their numbering).

This is similar to the thermometer concept of knowledge we provided in
\S\ref{explicit}, since like the thermometer view, it is incompatible
with a human perspective.  Hence we shall extend the following:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Irrationality Principle}: \emph{Since humans are not
   rational, views on epistemic logic that postulate this should be
   rejected}
\end{quote}
I should mention that while this perspective is not typically embraced
in epistemic logic\footnote{Noted exceptions to this are
  \citet{rantala_impossible_1982} and \citet{levesque_logic_1984}.},
it finds sympathy in other logical traditions, namely in
\emph{relevance logic} and \emph{paraconsistent logic}, as already
noted \citep[see][chapters 1 \& 4]{gabbay_handbook_2002}.

Apart from inconsistency, we do not really accommodate very much
irrationality; frameworks like
\citep{rantala_impossible_1982} and and \citet{levesque_logic_1984}
employing \emph{impossible world} semantics are far more accommodating
to irrationality than the semantics we are investigating.  However,
these frameworks do not provide compelling explanation for the
mechanism of irrationality, contrary to the perspective presented
here.  Regardless, allowing for an agents beliefs to be generated from
inconsistent premises is already orthogonal to the assumption that
agents are rational.

\subsection{Quine}\label{quine}
To recap, so far we
have suggested adding a novel modality $\BM$ which corresponds to
taking subsets of an agent's set of beliefs.  In the context of
conventional modal logic, this means a shift in perspective - instead
of thinking of each world as a situation where the agent can imagine
other situations, now each world corresponds to a network of beliefs
ordered by inclusion. These networks of beliefs form a poset, or
partially ordered set.  Thus the choice to visually represent them as
\emph{Hasse diagrams}, as we have done in Fig. \ref{fig:example1}, 
follows the standard practice in lattice theory. 

Furthermore, consider the following phenomenon - as higher
nodes in a belief network are considered, the agent is employing more
premises for the arguments they are composing, and using less pure
logic to come to conclusions.  This suggests that as we consider levels higher and higher in the poset of
an agent's beliefs, this corresponds to embracing an agent's
experience and interpretation of their sensory data.  Arguments
that rest on more premises are prima facie more fallible than
arguments that rely on fewer assumptions.

A similar perspective has been presented before, however in a
different setting, in \emph{Two Dogmas of Empiricism}:
\begin{quote}
{Certain statements, though about physical objects and not sense
  experience, seem peculiarly germane to sense experience -- and in a
  selective way: some statements to some experiences, others to
  others. Such statements, especially germane to particular
  experiences, I picture as near the periphery. But in this relation
  of ``germaneness'' I envisage nothing more than a loose association
  reflecting the relative likelihood, in practice, of our choosing one
  statement rather than another for revision in the event of
  recalcitrant experience. For example, we can imagine recalcitrant
  experiences to which we would surely be inclined to accommodate our
  system by re-evaluating just the statement that there are brick
  houses on Elm Street, together with related statements on the same
  topic. We can imagine other recalcitrant experiences to which we
  would be inclined to accommodate our system by re-evaluating just
  the statement that there are no centaurs, along with kindred
  statements. A recalcitrant experience can, I have already urged, be
  accommodated by any of various alternative re-evaluations in various
  alternative quarters of the total system; but, in the cases which we
  are now imagining, our natural tendency to disturb the total system
  as little as possible would lead us to focus our revisions upon
  these specific statements concerning brick houses or centaurs. These
  statements are felt, therefore, to have a sharper empirical
  reference than highly theoretical statements of physics or logic or
  ontology. \emph{The latter statements may be thought of as
    relatively centrally located within the total network, meaning
    merely that little preferential connection with any particular
    sense data obtrudes itself.} }\citep{quine_two_1951}
\end{quote}

The emphasis on the last sentence is our addition.  The above paragraph
importantly anticipates ideas in belief revision theory (such as in
\citet{alchourron_logic_1985} and subsequent studies), as well as
recent trends in probabilistic dynamic epistemic logic \citep[such as
in][etc.]{van_benthem_conditional_2003,van_benthem_dynamic_2009,baltag_probabilistic_2008,kooi_probabilistic_2003}.
However, in the framework has been developing so far, what
Quine refers to as the ``periphery'' of his web of belief corresponds
to a higher node in a belief poset, while what Quine referes to as the
``center'' reflects something like a lower node.  This is visually
depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:poset}.  Beliefs that are members of lower
nodes, and the ideas that follow from them, can be thought of as
belonging to the agent's world-view.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{poset/poset2.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A network of beliefs}
\label{fig:poset}
\end{figure}

The above observation informs a corresponding perspective on
epistemology.  If an agent's world view largely rested legends about
the Norse gods, we should be reluctant to say she knows various facts about
nature, such as why lightning strikes.  This is because all of her
explanations would inevitably be based upon myths in one way or
another, which would all occupy lower nodes in her belief network.
This dictates that \emph{sanity} plays a role in how much knowledge an
agent can have - it is permissible to grant that an inconsistent agent
has knowledge provided that the inconsistency follows only shallowly
from her experiential data, and it is something she would readily give
up.  However, if a contradiction is intrinsic to the agent's
psychology, and thus follows from a lower node in her belief poset,
this suggests she does not really have knowledge.  So while we
should believe that irrational agents can possess knowledge, as we have argued
in \S\ref{irrational}, we should rightfully not contend that they \emph{always} posses
knowledge. Moreover, the sort of irrationality that we are considering here
need not be superficial - both mundane as well as deeply demented characters can be modeled.

Note that the above essentially presents a subjective interpretation
of Quine's web of belief, which might be contentious.  On the other
hand, we should feel both the quote from Quine and the quote from 
Whitman in \S\ref{contradictions} suggest the following principle 
without too much controversy:
\begin{quote}
 \textbf{Quine/Whitman Principle}: \emph{Epistemic agents are compound
   entities, which invite compositional analysis.}
\end{quote}
The above presents a final philosophical principle that shall be extended
extend.  Apart from this, from the previous discussion may extract an additional thing:  Figure \ref{fig:poset}
naturally suggests that we might think of \emph{going up} in a belief
net, in a manner similar to how $\BM$ allows one to \emph{go down} as
 suggested in \S\ref{Descartes}. This suggests
the introduction of a new operator $\BP$.  The semantics for $\BP$ are
given as follows:
\[ \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \BP \phi \iff \textup{ for all }
(b,B)\in\Omega\textup{ if } b = a \textup{ and } A\subseteq B \textup{
  then } \Omega,(a,A) \VDash \phi \]
Just as $\BM$ corresponds to the agent casting assumptions into doubt,
or disregarding their premises, $\BP$ corresponds to the agent
embracing their experience, suspending disbelief and accepting her
intuitions and senses.

This concludes the presentation of novelties we propose for the
practice of modelling knowledge.

\subsection{Closing Remarks}
\label{close}
The various principles extended in the previous sections are not
independent - some of them are more basic than others.  Their
relationship is summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:principles} - here the
lower a principle is depicted, the more basic.  Dotted
lines indicate the philosophical justification for the
higher principle supervenes on the justification of the lower
principle.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{principles/principles.pdf} 
\end{center}
\caption{A visualization of the relationship of the principles
  presented here}
\label{fig:principles}
\end{figure}
In addition, in further development of the framework sketched in
\S\ref{explicit}, we shall want the following criteria, based on the ideas given in relevant sections:
\begin{description}
 \item[\S\ref{explicit}] \begin{bul}
                          \item Agents shall be modelled with proofs for the things they believe.
			  \item To avoid paradoxes, correct
                            foundations must be provided.  Ideally, we
                            would like our semantics to correspond to a
                            provably terminating computation, granting
                            certain non-deterministic operations such
                            as a  \emph{choice operator}
                            $\varepsilon$, as described in
                            \citep{hilbert_neubegrndung_1922}.

  \item[] For a set of beliefs $A$:
\begin{description}
  \item[\S\ref{soundness}] It should be expressible whether everything in $A$ is sound 
  \item[\S\ref{Descartes}] Certain subsets $B\subseteq A$ should be accessible
  \item[\S\ref{quine}] Certain extensions $B \supseteq A$ could also be accessed
\end{description}
\end{description}
In line with evidentialist epistemology, as mentioned in
\S\ref{sketch}, we have decided to call the logic presented here
\emph{Evidentialist Logic}, or \textsc{EviL} for brevity.

\section{Introduction to \textsc{EviL}}\label{evil-semantics}
%\subsection{Forward}
From with the philosophical intuitions and scaffolding provided from
\S\ref{philosophy}, we shall present a precise account of the previously
developed ideas.  This shall be done in three movements:
\begin{description}
 \item[\S\ref{basic-evil}]  In the first section we shall provide the
   basic grammar and semantics for \textsc{EviL} with a single agent;
   the presentation in this section will remain primarily
   philosophical and light.
 \item[\S\ref{dead-by-dawn}]  In the second section we develop several
   topics in the pure theory of \textsc{EviL} which are considered a bit
   beyond the bare essentials.
  \item[\S\ref{army-of-darkness}]  In this section, logics for
    \textsc{EviL} are presented, along with completeness 
     and decidability.
\end{description}

% from that section provided by the previous section into a provide an outline
% for the basic grammar and semantics of \textsc{EviL}. I also try to develop
% intuitions about how I personally read these semantics, and provide examples of
% various validities.

% 
% Having developed \textsc{EviL}, I feel it necessary to reengage the philosophical concerns presented in \S\ref{Human-Condition}.  \textsc{EviL} was a project to try to base an epistemic logic more on intuition and human nature, rather than the more mechanical foundation which forms the basis for mainstream epistemic logic.
