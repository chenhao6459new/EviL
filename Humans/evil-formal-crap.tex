In this section we provide a complete axiomatization of
multi-agent \textsc{EviL}.  In addition to axiomatics, we shall also
look at subsystems and supersystems of \textsc{EviL}, and provide
complexity bounds on \textsc{EviL} decision procedures. 

We have organized this section in the following manner:
\begin{description}
 \item[\S\ref{evil-axioms}] We first present a sound axiom
   system for \textsc{EviL}.

 \item[\S\ref{abstraction}] Next, we give a definition of the
   class of \emph{partly \textsc{EviL}} Kripke models.  

   We then reveal that \textsc{EviL} is sound and strongly complete
   for the class of partly \textsc{EviL} models. 
   Completeness rests on the observation that the
   axioms of \textsc{EviL} are all in the \emph{Sahlqvist fragment},
   or have obvious meanings in terms of the traditional canonical
   model construction for Modal Logic.
   This abstract completeness for \textsc{EviL} can be understood as
   an elementary application of van Benthem's 
   \emph{correspondence theory} for modal logic.

\item[\S\ref{completely-evil}]  In this section we recall the definition of an
  \emph{\textsc{EviL} Kripke Model}, as we gave in Definition
  \ref{evil-kripke-structures} from \S\ref{kripke}, and show that
  every \emph{partly \textsc{EviL}} Kripke model may be
  ``completed'' by constructing a bisimilar \emph{\textsc{EviL}} 
   model.

   This has, as a consequence, that \textsc{EviL} is complete for
   \textsc{EviL} Kripke Models.

\item[\S\ref{taking-stock}]  In this section, we discuss why the abstract
  completeness proof developed in the previous sections, while
  important, is not adequate in light of the developments in
  \S\ref{basic-evil} and the intuitions we saw in that section.  We
  shall sketch what further needs to be shown to give the desired
  completeness theorem for \textsc{EviL}.

\item[\S\ref{small-model}]  In this section we show that
  \textsc{EviL} has a small model property for \emph{partly
    \textsc{EviL}} Kripke models. This is accomplished by constructing
     a Kripke model consisting of finite maximally
     consistent sets in the manner of the Fischer-Ladner closure style
     completeness proof of PDL 
     \cite[chapter 4, pgs. 241--248]{blackburn_modal_2001}.

% \item[\S\ref{decidability}] 
%    From our construction in the previous section, we obtain a decidability
%    result for \textsc{EviL}, and provide upper and lower bounds on the
%    complexity of the \textsc{EviL} decision problem.

  \item[\S\ref{islands}] In this section, we introduce the concept of an
    \emph{island}, which are special equivalence classes for
    \textsc{EviL} models.  We shall prove several properties, which take the
    form of irreducibilities. 

\item[\S\ref{translation}]Following the proof of Proposition
  \ref{translation-sketch} in \S\ref{sketch}, we shall show that every
  finite \textsc{EviL} Kripke structure is \emph{(almost)-homomorphic} to another,
  \textsc{EviL} model we shall call $\ipent$, provided that we have an
  infinite number of letters in $\Phi$.  
  We shall show that there is a map $\kl$ of worlds in $\mathbb{M}$ to
  worlds in $\ipent$ that preserves formulae in a language
  $\mathcal{L}(\Psi,\mathcal{A})$ where 
$\Psi \subseteq_\omega \Phi$.

  The construction of $\ipent$ shall make use of the island structures introduced
  in the previous section, and here we will also introduce the concept of
  \emph{names} and \emph{surnames}.

We have, as a consequence of the above, we shall be able to show that
$\textsc{EviL}$ is weakly complete for $\textsc{EviL}$ models.

  % \item[\S\ref{skarmy-of-darkness}]  In this section, we employ our
  %   previous results to remark that \textsc{EviL} is weakly complete for
  %   \textsc{EviL} models.

\item[\S\ref{taking-stockII}]  In this section, we once again pause to
  take stock of the results we have established in previous sections.
  We discuss how our results give rise to complexity observations for
  \textsc{EviL}, and discuss the relationship between the abstract
  completeness we have previously established and our concrete 
  completeness.

  \item[\S\ref{subsystems}] We next introduce two
    subsystems of \textsc{EviL}, corresponding to the $\BP$ and $\BM$
    only fragments. We briefly go over the completeness theorems and
    finite model property for these systems.  In each case, a special
    bisimulation theorem is in order to achieve completeness.

  \item[\S\ref{supersystems}] We provide an extension to
    \textsc{EviL} and its subsystems, introducing the universal
    modality $U$. We sketch completeness and the finite model
    property, and mention how translation may be extended to this
    system.

 \item[\S\ref{lattice}]  In this section we give a lattice of
   \textsc{EviL} systems, and discuss the known complexity bounds of
   various levels of this lattice.
